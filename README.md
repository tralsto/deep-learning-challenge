## In this example, I utilized a neural network and deep learning methods to create a model to help the nonprofit foundation, AlphabetSoup, predict whether or not applicants will be successful in receiving funding.

### To achieve this I will take the given CSV file containing the 34,000+ organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Using this I will create a new model which will learn from this dataset and be able to predict whether new applicants will be likely to receive funding or not.

### To accomplish this my model follows these steps:
### 1. Preprocessing the Data
### 2. Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
### 3. Optimizing the Model

### Following the completion of the model, I analyzed it's overall performance and function in my analysis report which is included in this repository. My summary of the overall results of the model have created is as follows:
