1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
    - The purpose of this analysis is to use the previous applicant data from the CSV file to build a model to help predict if new applicants will receive funding from the AlphabetSoup organization.


2. Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:
    Data Preprocessing
    - What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
        The target for the model is the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column.

    - What variable(s) are the features for your model?
        The features are all the other columns in the data frame besides the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column.

    - What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?



    Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?


    - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?


    - What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?



3. Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
